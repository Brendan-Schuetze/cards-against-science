# Cards against science

Scientists need to have some fun every now and then. Take a jab at science with this game and have a good time with your colleagues (but don't you ever party with non-sciencey people?).

Liberate Science deviates from the usual CC 0 rights waiver because Cards Against Humanity is licensed CC BY NC SA (we only upgrade the 2.0 to 4.0).

# Contribution guidelines

Have at it. If you want to have your suggestions be incorporated, please submit a pull request following these guidelines

1. Use 6 underscores for the blanks (______) for consistency.

2. Use HTML codes to stylize your cards, but limit yourself to:
	<b></b> Bold text. Note that card lettering is bold by default, so you may need to add a closing </b> tag to eliminate the bold format, followed by another <b> tag to reinstate it.
	<i></i> Italic text.
	<u></u> Underlined text.
	<strikethrough></strikethrough> Strike-through text.
	<sub></sub> Subscript text.
	<sup></sup> Superscript text.
